Here is all the information you need to know about the different towers:


THREAD TOWER: This tower is the simplest tower, attacking a single virus at a moderate rate.

GLITCH TOWER: This tower stuns viruses that it hits, dealing a reduced amount of damage but temporarily stopping the viruses in place.

GARBAGE COLLECTION TOWER: This tower reclaims RAM from dead viruses whose processes have ended, giving bonus credits for the purchase of towers to the player when a Collection Tower deals the killing blow to a virus.

PROCESS MODERATOR TOWER: This tower monitors and equalizes the healths of the viruses passing through by prioritizing the virus in its range with the highest health.

PROCESS TERMINATOR TOWER: This tower picks off and ends specific viruses by prioritizing the virus in its range with the lowest health.

BREAK TOWER: This tower snipes viruses from afar, dealing a high amount of damage at a very high range at the cost of a long time period in between shots.

WIPE TOWER: This tower aims at the middle of its targeted group and deals raid area-of-effect damage in a small radius.

MULTITHREAD TOWER: This tower is multithreaded, able to focus up to three viruses at once.

MEMORY TOWER: This tower recalls its attacking process in memory as it attacks in rapid succession, allowing the tower to reduce its cooldown progressively so long as an in-range virus exists for it when it's ready to attack.

LOAD TOWER: This tower fires a massive processing load onto nearby viruses, dealing a massive amount of damage that is divided evenly among all viruses hit.
